Double Pointer
Easy:
  interview 10.01: easy to figure out time O(n+m) space O(n+m)
                   reverse pointer => A's value won't be modified before being taken. => time O(n+m) space O(1)
  interview 02.02: easy to figure out that one traverse is needed
                   => pre cur pointers => when pre is at the end, cur is the answer => pre is k-1 in front of cur
                   => time O(n+k) space O(1)
